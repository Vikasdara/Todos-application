Mark tasks as completed (strikethrough effect applied to completed tasks).

Delete tasks from the list.

Save tasks locally using LocalStorage so they persist across sessions.

Responsive design with a clean user interface.

Project Structure

|-- index.html   # Main HTML file
|-- styles.css   # Stylesheet for the project
|-- script.js    # JavaScript file for to-do list functionality

How It Works

The user enters a task in the input box and clicks "Add" to include it in the to-do list.

The task appears in the list with a checkbox and delete icon.

Clicking the checkbox marks the task as completed (strikethrough text).

Clicking the delete icon removes the task from the list.

The tasks are stored in LocalStorage and persist even after refreshing the page.

Clicking "Save" manually stores the current tasks in LocalStorage.
